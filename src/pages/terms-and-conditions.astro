        Terms and Conditions – AC Plumbers Ltd. Brighton
      </h1>
      <p class="mb-8 text-base text-gray-700">
        For the purposes of these Terms of Business (hereinafter, “Terms”), “us”
        or “we” shall refer to AC Plumbers Ltd., and “you” shall refer to you,
        our customer. By requesting and allowing us to carry out works for you,
        you are confirming your agreement to the Terms below.
      </p>

      <h2 class="mb-2 text-xl font-semibold text-primary-600">1. Estimate</h2>
      <p class="mb-6 text-gray-700">
        The value of the estimate is what we expect to charge you for the works,
        based on our initial discussions. In the event of unforeseen
        circumstances or unexpected issues arising, it may be necessary to
        review the original price and provide you with a new estimate. You have
        the right to accept or decline the revised price.
      </p>
      <hr class="my-8 border-primary-200" />
      <h2 class="mb-2 text-xl font-semibold text-primary-600">
        2. Written Quotation
      </h2>
      <p class="mb-6 text-gray-700">
        The written quotation follows the estimate and is the final price for
        the agreed works, including labour, materials, additional costs (if
        any), and VAT.<br />Any subsequent variation to the works (for example,
        if you change the scope or if unforeseen circumstances arise) will
        likely result in a new quotation. Should you decline the revised
        quotation, all works will cease, and you must pay in full for all works
        already completed in accordance with the original quotation.
      </p>
      <hr class="my-8 border-primary-200" />
