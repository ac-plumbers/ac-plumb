title: Gas safety checks (CP12) and Gas Safety Certificates
description: Gas safety checks (CP12) are essential for ensuring the safe operation of gas appliances and installations. These checks are required by law for landlords and are crucial for preventing gas leaks, explosions, and carbon monoxide poisoning. A Gas Safety Certificate is issued after a qualified engineer conducts a thorough inspection of all gas appliances, flues, and pipework. This certificate confirms that the appliances are safe to use and comply with safety regulations. Regular gas safety checks help maintain the integrity of gas systems, ensuring the safety of occupants and compliance with legal requirements. It is recommended that these checks be performed annually to ensure ongoing safety and reliability.
