For the purposes of these Terms of Business (hereinafter, "Terms"), "us" or "we" shall refer to AC Plumbers Ltd., and "you" shall refer to you, our customer. By requesting and allowing us to carry out works for you, you are confirming your agreement to the Terms below.

## 1. Estimate

The value of the estimate is what we expect to charge you for the works, based on our initial discussions. In the event of unforeseen circumstances or unexpected issues arising, it may be necessary to review the original price and provide you with a new estimate. You have the right to accept or decline the revised price.

## 2. Written Quotation

The written quotation follows the estimate and is the final price for the agreed works, including labour, materials, additional costs (if any), and VAT. Any subsequent variation to the works (for example, if you change the scope or if unforeseen circumstances arise) will likely result in a new quotation. Should you decline the revised quotation, all works will cease, and you must pay in full for all works already completed in accordance with the original quotation.

## 3. Client Obligations

- If you provide measurements for materials/products, you bear the cost of replacing them if incorrect.
- If you supply materials/products, you bear the cost if they are faulty or unsuitable.
- You must inform us of any hazards on the premises before work begins.
- You must provide us with access to the premises and ensure all necessary consents, permissions, and licences are obtained.
- You are responsible for the safe storage of materials/equipment left at your premises during the works.
- You will be responsible for any redecorating or improvements required after completion unless otherwise agreed.

## 4. Our Obligations

- We will carry out the works with due care, skill, and diligence and comply with all relevant laws and regulations.
- We will supply quality materials/products and replace any that prove faulty or substandard (unless provided by you).
- We will take care of your property and remove waste materials on completion.
- We will supply qualified engineers or plumbers to carry out the works. The individual may differ from the person who prepared your quotation.
- We confirm that we hold valid Public Liability Insurance and Employers Liability Insurance (where relevant).

## 5. Materials and Products

All materials/products supplied during the works remain the property of AC Plumbers Ltd. until full payment is received. Title transfers to you only once payment has been made in full.

## 6. Force Majeure

Neither party shall be held liable for any delay or failure caused by circumstances beyond their control, including but not limited to fire, natural disaster, government action, supply shortages, or industrial disputes.

## 7. Cancellation Rights

In line with the Consumer Contract Regulations 2013, you have the right to cancel the contract within fourteen (14) days of accepting our quotation. If you request works to begin during this period, you are obligated to pay for any services provided before cancellation.

## 8. Payments

Payment terms are set out in your quotation. All invoices must be settled in full upon completion of works. Late payments may incur interest at 5% above the Bank of England base rate until payment is received.

## 9. Complaints

We aim to provide a high-quality service at all times. If you have any concerns, please contact us directly and we will work to resolve the issue promptly.
